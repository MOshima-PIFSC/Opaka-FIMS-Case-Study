1 NOTE:  Max data length bin: 85  < max pop len bins: 94; so will accumulate larger pop len bins
2 Forecast=0 or -1, so rest of forecast file will not be read and can be omitted;
3 NOTE: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
 N parameters are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 1; check results, variance may be suspect
N warnings: 3
