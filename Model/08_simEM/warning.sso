Note 1 Suggestion: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
Note 2 Suggestion: Are you sure you want so few early recrdevs? Better to include in range of main recdevs 4
Note 3 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 1; check results, variance may be suspect
